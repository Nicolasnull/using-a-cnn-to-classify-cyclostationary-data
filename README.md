## Overview

## Flow
If you are starting with the original images, you will have to run them through the crops_notebook to crop them to the correct size. After you have obtained cropped images (either by running the originals through the crops_notebook or starting with cropped images), you must load the images into dataloaders. This is done in the load_images notebook. Finally, to create, train and test the CNN on your images, run the creating_and_training_network notebook. The results of your run will be in the outputs of the notebook as well as saved in the output_files folder.
## Our Results

## External Resources
We plan on publishing a paper on this project. If we are successful, we will post the link here. We will also publish the screenshots we used. Once that is accomplished, we will include the information here.
## Additional Thanks
We would like to thank the <a href="https://first2network.org/">First2Network</a> for helping label the cyclostationary data. We would also like to thank <a href="https://www.xsede.org/">XSEDE Empower</a> for helping fund our research.
